# Artist Statement

- What my artwork is.
My interactive artwork “Symphony of Squares and Circles” is a dynamic installation consisting of a number of floating musical notes, in which the notes are presented in the form of circles and squares. Each note graphic corresponds to a specific scale and its shape directly affects its timbre. When a note graphic collides with the page boundaries, other notes, or audience interactions (e.g., ripples triggered by tapping on the screen), the corresponding note is played, the shape of the graphic is changed, and the playback is briefly stopped. In this way, as these note shapes move freely through the space and collide with each other, they work together to create a moving symphony.


- How interaction enhances the viewer’s experience.
Using the mouse, the viewer can interact with the note shapes. Whenever the viewer moves the mouse, the note shapes move away from the cursor, allowing the viewer to manipulate the direction of movement of the note shapes through the mouse. In addition, the audience can click on the screen to create a ripple that not only collides with the note pattern, but also triggers the sound and shape of the note. This interactive approach makes the audience not only a spectator, but also a participant in the symphony.
